# JitExplorer

Like compiler explorer, but for .NET JIT.

Window on the left has c# code
https://github.com/robinrodricks/ScintillaNET.Demo

Window on the right has JIT assembler
Will need to compile the c# code then disassemble. Can use same method as benchmarkdotnet via iced.

Have pull downs to select CLR version, debug/release etc.
